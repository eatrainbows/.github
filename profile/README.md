We are **EatRainbows** — a team of dreamers, builders, and rule-breakers dedicated to creating unforgettable digital experiences. We believe **fun** is more than just a distraction—it's a way of life. Our goal? To turn every interaction into something that sparks **joy, laughter, and excitement**.

**🎮 Games. 💡 Apps. 🔥 Social experiences.** We love breaking barriers between **technology** and **human creativity**. If it gets people talking, laughing, and coming back for more, we know we’re on the right track.

We're cooking up something. It's fun. It's wild. It's the kind of thing that makes you go *"just one more round"*. But we can't say too much... yet. 🤫

Here’s what we can say:\
✅ **It’s fast.** Blink, and you might miss your shot.\
🤝 **It’s social.** The more, the merrier.\
🎭 **It’s unpredictable.** Every moment is a surprise.\
🎵 **It’s musical… kind of.** You’ll see. 😉

We’re blending **competition, creativity, and pure, unfiltered fun** into something that will keep you on your toes. If you've ever **shouted at a friend over a game**, **laughed until you cried**, or **completely lost track of time** in the heat of a challenge—you’re going to love this.

**Curious? You should be.**\
We’re crafting something **special**, and the best part is, this is just the beginning. Follow our journey, keep an eye out for updates, and get ready for an experience unlike any other.
