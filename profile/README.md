## ![github-eatrainbows who we are](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ea5f9a7-ab71-4cdd-aeb1-bdf29f3bef72)
We are EatRainbows â€” a team of dreamers, builders, and rule-breakers dedicated to creating unforgettable digital experiences. We believe fun is more than just a distractionâ€”it's a way of life. Our goal? To turn every interaction into something that sparks joy, laughter, and excitement.

Games. Apps. Social experiences. We love breaking barriers between technology and human creativity. If it gets people talking, laughing, and coming back for more, we know weâ€™re on the right track.

We're cooking up something. It's fun. It's wild. It's the kind of thing that makes you go *"just one more round"*. But we can't say too much... yet. ðŸ¤«
